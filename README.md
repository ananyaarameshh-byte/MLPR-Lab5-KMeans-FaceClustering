# Machine Learning Lab 5 – Face Clustering using K-Means

## Aim
The aim of this experiment is to perform clustering on face images using K-Means based on hue and saturation features extracted from images.

## Methodology
- Detected faces from given images using OpenCV
- Converted images to HSV color space
- Extracted hue and saturation values
- Applied K-Means clustering to group similar faces
- Visualised clusters and centroids
- Predicted cluster of a template image (Dr. Shashi Tharoor)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Key Findings
- Faces were successfully clustered into two groups based on color features.
- Hue and saturation are useful features for basic image clustering.
- The template image was correctly assigned to one of the clusters.

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrated how K-Means clustering can be used for basic image classification tasks. It also showed how feature extraction plays an important role in machine learning models.
